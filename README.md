# arithmetic-test

A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. Generate random questions (2 numbers only) consisting of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

The system should ask the student's name and then ask ten questions. The program should feed back if the answers are correct or not, and then generate a final score at the end.
